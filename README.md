### Due Thursday, February 23rd

Please fork this repository, and add me as a collaborator.

The slides posted on Moodle have our notes from class, and will be more beneficial to you for this assignment.  I've included the file grad_desc.py for those of you who are at a loss for how to begin!  Use it as a guide.  If you have any questions, come to my office hour on Tuesday from 2 - 3.  If that time isn't good for you, feel free to make an appointment.

Also, to note, Harold has office hours Tuesday and Thursday from 9:30 am - 10:30 am.
