### Due Thursday, February 23rd

Please fork this repository, and add me as a collaborator.

The slides posted on Moodle have our notes from class, and will be more beneficial to you for this assignment.  If you have any questions, come to my office hour on Tuesday from 2 - 3.  If that time isn't good for you, feel free to make an appointment.

Also, to note, Harold has office hours Tuesday and Thursday from 9:30 am - 10:30 am.
